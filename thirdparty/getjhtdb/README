# JHTDB DEMO_C adapted into a library

The JHTDB DEMO_C example has been slightly adapted to expose the "getData" function into a library.
A minimal CMake configuration is provided for building.
For convenience the original README is provided in the following.

# DEMO_C: A JHTDB Interface Library for C

See the end of the file for license conditions.

## About this package

This project provides a C implementation for retrieving and processing turbulence data from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database (JHTDB). It allows users to query various turbulence datasets and perform spatial and temporal interpolations on the data. Supported Datasets, fields that can be queried, interpolation methods and spatial operation types are explained as comments in the code. More information can be found at: https://turbulence.idies.jhu.edu.

The DEMO_Getdata_C.c program is a simple demonstration that demonstrates:

1. Setting up a 2D plane of points
2. Retrieving velocity data at these points
3. Printing out to screen 10 of these points and queried velocities
4. Writing the results to a VTK file for visualization

`make` will build the C sample (DEMO_Getdata_C) code.  Users only need to work with the DEMO_Getdata_C.c code (e.g. edit this file to select other points and datasets to be queried). This code calls a main function getdata.c which is the interface to JHTDB that, among others, uses the curl package as well as various JSON utilities. Users do not need to edit any of these other files.

## Prerequisites

Before building the project, curl and cJSON libraries are required:

### Linux Users:

(1) Install curl
Install the required development libraries:

 sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

On some HPC systems you may need to run:
 module load curl

(2) Install cJSON
cJSON is built already for Linux system  

### macOS Users for which curl is not installed as part of Xcode
(1) Install curl
 brew install curl

(2) Unzip and compile 'DEMO_C_MAC.tar' source code
 cJSON is built already for macOS system

## Building the Project (if the above two packages are installed already, run directly)

1. Clean any previous builds:
 make clean

2. Compile the project:
 make

3. Run the demo:
 ./DEMO_Getdata_C

## Output

The program generates a VTK file (`output2D_C.vtk`) containing the processed data, which can be visualized using VTK-compatible visualization tools such as Paraview. The program also prints out 10 values of position and queried velocities to screen. 

## Authentication

The program uses an authentication token for accessing the JHTDB. The default token allows calls up to 4096 points at a time and is:
```
edu.jhu.pha.turbulence.testing-201406
```
While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep track of who is using the service, and how. To this end, we would like each user to obtain an authorization token from us, which then allows users to download larger number of points. Please visit 
[https://turbulence.idies.jhu.edu/database](https://turbulence.idies.jhu.edu/database)  for information about soliciting a JHTDB token.
